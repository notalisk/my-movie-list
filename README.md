# ReelGood movie database

The ReelGood movie database app provides users with a comprehensive and user-friendly platform to search for movies and manage their movie watching activities. Its primary objective is to enhance users' overall movie viewing experience by making it easy for them to find and explore new movies. The app's features, such as the love it or hate it rating system, help users keep track of their movie preferences and make better-informed decisions when choosing what to watch next.

## Features
- **Movie Search:** Users can search for movies using keywords or movie titles in the search bar and rate the movies they have seen directly on the search screen using "Seen it(Love it)" and "Seen it(Hate it)".

- **Watchlist:** Users can add movies to their watchlist and view them later. They can also rate movies as "Reel-y Love it" or "Reel-y Hate it" to keep track of their movie preferences.

- **Streaming Platform Information:** Users can conveniently view the streaming platforms currently offering the movie from the search results page, saving them time and effort when identifying where to watch the movie.

- **Concept:** The ReelGood movie database app was born out of the creator's love for movies and the desire to keep track of their preferences. The app aims to provide a streamlined and user-friendly experience for movie enthusiasts, enabling them to easily discover, track, and enjoy their favorite movies.
